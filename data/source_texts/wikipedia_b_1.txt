Peter Behrens (14 April 1868 â€“ 27 February 1940) was a leading German architect and industrial designer, best known for his early pioneering Modernist AEG Turbine Hall in Berlin in 1909. He had a long career, designing objects and important buildings in a range of styles from the 1900s to the 1930s. He was a leader in the 1900s of the German Jugendstil movement, and foundation member of the German Werkbund in 1907, pioneered corporate design, producing typefaces, objects, and buildings for AEG, and then became a successful architect in the Neo-Classical Reform Movement of the 1910s. After WW1 he turned to Brick Expressionism, designing the remarkable Hoechst Administration Building outside Frankfurt, and from the mid 1920s increasingly to New Objectivity. He was also an educator, heading the architecture school at Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from 1922-1936. As a well known architect he produced design across Germany, in other European countries, Russia and England. Several of the leading names of European modernism worked for him when they were starting out, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius.
