Son of a Californian pool hall manager, Lloyd entered films as a teenager at the fun factories run by Hal Roach and Mack Sennett, and in 1917 invented a screen persona that lasted him for life – that of a sympathetic, slightly naïf middle-class go-getter wearing a suit, tie, boater and horn-rimmed glasses. He owned what he produced and became rich. In his best, most famous movie, the magnificent Safety Last (1923), he plays an accident-prone small-town boy in New York. Its climax sees Lloyd ascending a skyscraper Kong-style, one of the scariest, funniest sequences ever made
